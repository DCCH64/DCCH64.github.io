# Getting Started with DCCH64

Hey, nice that you found your way to DCCH64. You are interested in Raspberry Pi, electronics and scale railroads? We have the perfect project for you. You can build with our software your own digital control station for your DCC scale railroad. **Besides** from the **fun and knowledge** building your own gives you, you save around â‚¬400 building with your own tools and components and you have **no limits and freedom to customize as much as you want**! Repairing it or adding new features you really needed? Not a problem with our solution. **All this completely for free***

## Getting Started

1. You can install it from git:

``$ git clone https://github.com/DCCH64/MainStation.git && npm install && node index.js``

2. You can deploy it to balenaOS by one click **(best option)**

### What you'll need

- A working track and DCC locomotives
- All the components built together (you don't need housing, but if you want it be creative :-) )
- The [Web Client](https://dcch64.github.io/webclient)
